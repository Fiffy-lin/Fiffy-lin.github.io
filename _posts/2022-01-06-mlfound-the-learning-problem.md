# Learning to Machine Learning

ML: Acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from data. Data is upper bound, algorithm is just going to reach that bound.

Key essence of ML:

- Exists some underlying pattern to be learned. (to measure performance)
- No easy definition by pure rule-based method. (otherwise why not go with rule?)
- Has some data about the pattern. (so ml algorithm has inputs.)

Model = Algorithm + Hypothesis set

# Why Hypothesis Set

Hypothesis set: Human task, human selects where answer should be in.

Learning algorithm: Computer's automatic job to find optimal answer in hypothesis set.

# ML/DM/AI or Statistics?

- DM: Using data to find something interesting.

  In many senario, those two are quite similar, but traditional DM also focus on efficient computation.

- AI: compute something that can show intelligent behavior.

  ML can realize AI.

- Statistics: Using data to make inference about unknown process.

  Statistics can be used to achieve ML. Traditional statistics also fous on math proving.
