### Learning to Machine Learning

ML: Acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from data. Data is upper bound, algorithm is just going to reach that bound.

Key essence of ML:

- Exists some underlying pattern to be learned. (to measure performance)
- No easy definition by pure rule-based method. (otherwise why not go with rule?)
- Has some data about the pattern. (so ml algorithm has inputs.)

Model = Algorithm + Hypothesis set
