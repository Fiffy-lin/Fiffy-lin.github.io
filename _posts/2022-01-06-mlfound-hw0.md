# 1. Probability and Statistics

(1) Let C(N, K) = 1 for K = 0 or K = N, and C(N, K) = C(N − 1, K) + C(N − 1, K − 1) for N ≥ 1. Prove that C(N, K) = N!/K!(N−K)! for N ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ K ≤ N.

(2) What is the probability of getting exactly 4 heads when flipping 10 fair coins? What is the probability of getting a full house (XXXYY) when randomly drawing 5 cards out of a deck of 52 cards?

(3) If your friend flipped a fair coin three times, and tell you that one of the tosses resulted in head, what is the probability that all three tosses resulted in heads?

(4) A program selects a random integer X like this: a random bit is first generated uniformly. If the bit is 0, X is drawn uniformly from {0, 1, . . . , 7}; otherwise, X is drawn uniformly from {0, −1, −2, −3}. If we get an X from the program with |X| = 1, what is the probability that X is negative?

(5) If P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.4, what is the maximum possible value of P(A ∩ B)? what is the minimum possible value of P(A ∩ B)? what is the maximum possible value of P(A ∪ B)? what is the minimum possible value of P(A ∪ B)?
